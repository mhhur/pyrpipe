.. _Tutorial Overview:

Tutorial
========

This tutorial provides an introduction to pyrpipe. 
New users can start here to get an idea of how to use pyrpipe APIs for RNA-Seq or other analysis.
This tutorial is divided into smaller sections.

Section 1 describes the recommended way of installing pyrpipe and setting up conda environments.

Section 2 is  an introduction to basic RNA-Seq API is provided via a simple RNA-Seq processing pipeline example.

Section 3 provides information on how to extend pipelines using third-party tools and integrate pyrpipe into snakemake for more scalable workflows.
 
Subsequent Sections detail pyrpipe_engine, pyrpipe_module and pyrpipe_diagnostic, each of which provide reproducibility and helpful functionality.
